	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>Hi, Thanks for landing on to my website. I must warn you that your exploration might go a little bumpy. 
		I have tried my best to make this page clutter free but it still has a colorful hotchpotch of everything, my life. 
		These words don’t define me and if you want to know better, I would love to get connected on 
		<a href="https://twitter.com/ajlkn">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/debasmita.banerjee.3304">Facebook</a>, 
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/debasmita-banerjee-a2b816163/">LinkedIn</a> and
		<a href="https://www.instagram.com/visiondarkdemi19/?hl=en">Instagram</a>.
		However, formally, these are the following things that I am currently interested in. 
<ul> 
	<li> Nonlinear Dynamics (Tutorials, Codes, Project outlines) </li>
        <li> Photonics (Tutorials, Codes, Project outlines) </li>
	<li> Electrical Engineering (It’s between you and me, this is how I survived B.Tech. (wink)) </li>
	<li> Misc Disc (Mathematical computation, Neurodynamics, Biodetection, Plasma systems) </li>
	<li> Blog about everything else(Animes, books, Outreach activities, day to day feelings) </li>
</ul>
If you wish to meet, you can find me in the Plasma Physics Department, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Room No. 202. I also run a website called 1kwords.com (Subscribe to Youtube channel) with a vision to bring every other reader, author and educator on the same platform. I am an author of two great websites of Tech and Travel namely CrazyEngineers.com and TalkTravelapp.com. I hugely support nonprofit organizations especially the ones directed towards a long term vision for eg. Education. For next years, I plan to stay in the editorial board of SPIE Careerlab.
